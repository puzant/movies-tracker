Bridges is a bit self-serious. Amazing visuals. Really enjoyed...was glad and a bit bored by the end. Shorter Dunes please.",

    'FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/dune-part-two-review-the-new-generational-epitome-of-sci-fi-epics/\r\n\r\n"Dune: Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations, establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking.\r\n\r\nWith a narrative that deepens the complex web of political relationships, power, faith, love, and destiny, it not only provides a breathtaking audiovisual spectacle, thanks to the genius of Denis Villeneuve, Greig Fraser, and Hans Zimmer, but it also offers a profound meditation on universal human themes through thematically rich world-building and thoroughly developed characters. The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.\r\n\r\nIt warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics."\r\n\r\nRating: A+',
